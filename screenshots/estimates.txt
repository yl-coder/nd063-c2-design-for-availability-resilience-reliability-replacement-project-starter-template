### Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
The minimum rto could be only a few seconds as there is a standby instance running on another AZ.

### Minimum RTO for a single region outage
If it is a region outage, we will need to promote the read replica on the another region to master. This could take around few hours

The steps to take is as follow:
1) Promote the Read Replica.
2) Direct database traffic to the new master.
3) Create a replacement Read Replica.

We can automate all these operations using Amazon Simple Workflow service and calling amazon rds apis to reduce the time needed for this case.

### Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
RPO in seconds as there is a warm standby in another AZ

### Minimum RPO for a single region outage
RPO in minutes as we have a read replica at another region.
